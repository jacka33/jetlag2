SleepLag is a hobby project which helps users understand the impact of their long-haul flight on their sleep physiology. 

It provides actionable advice and schedules - based on the user's usual sleep routine, chronotype (i.e. morning person or night owl), age, and more - in conjunction with their flight information, to adjust the user's circadian rhythm to the new timezone and reduce the effect of jetlag.
